# 🏋️ All in One Fitness App

A **role-based Fitness Club Management System** built using **ASP.NET MVC** to automate gym and health club operations such as membership management, attendance tracking, events, payments, and fitness guidance.

---

## 📖 About the Project

As fitness clubs grow, manual management of members, trainers, schedules, and payments becomes inefficient.  
The **All in One Fitness App** provides a centralized web application where:

- Users can register, choose memberships, attend gyms, and track fitness
- Trainers and experts can guide users through videos and tips
- Admins can manage the entire system digitally

This system is inspired by platforms like **Cult Fit**, combining **physical gym access** with **digital fitness services**.
